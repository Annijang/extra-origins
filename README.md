```
Floran
+ Sneak using on a fertilizable block with an empty hand will grow plants at the cost of some food.
+ You are satiated by being exposed to sunlight.
+ You deal 2 more damage when wet.
- You take twice as much damage from fire.
- You can only consume honey bottles.

Truffle
+- You can switch between different Magic Spores. Red Cap boosts offense, Green Cap boosts defense, and Blue Cap boosts mobility. Changing Spores will decrease the abilities of the other two Caps.
+ Sneak using on a soil block with an empty hand will turn it into mycelium at the cost of some food.
+ You gain buffs based on the Spore you have active when standing on mycelium. Red Cap increases attack speed, Green Cap grants knockback immunity, and Blue Cap amplifies jump height.
+- Food is decomposed before it's consumed, nullifying any status effects you would otherwise gain

Inchling
+- You are 4 times smaller than a regular person. You have 5 less hearts, 0.5 more attack speed, 0.25 less attack range, and 1 less build range.
+ You are immune to thorns and velocity based damage. You are not slowed down at all by blocks such as sweet berry bushes or cobwebs. You can walk on powder snow.
+ You exhaust much slower than others, thus requiring you to eat less.
+ You are able to climb up any kind of wall, not just ladders.
+ You can ride other players.

Piglin:
+ Golden tools deal extra damage and golden armor has additional protection. Golden equipment lasts much longer, but non golden and non netherite equipment breaks faster. Netherite armor gives a small speed boost.
+ Piglins do not attack you unless provoked. Brutes will still attack on sight.
+ You deal 75% more damage with crossbows.
- Your natural spawn will be in the Nether.
+- When outside of the Nether, you zombify, becoming undead and immune to fire, but slower.
- Your diet is restricted to meat, you can't eat vegetables.
- You have 2 less hearts of health than humans.
- You are afraid of soul fire, becoming weak when near it.
